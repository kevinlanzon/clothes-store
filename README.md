Requirements
-------

- [x] As a User I can add a product to my shopping cart
- [x] As a User I can remove a product from my shopping cart
- [x] As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart
- [x] As a User I can apply a voucher to my shopping cart
- [x] As a User I can view the total price for the products in my shopping cart with discounts applied
- [x] As a User I am alerted when I apply an invalid voucher to my shopping cart
- [x] As a User I am unable to add Out of Stock products to the shopping cart
- [x] Website is responsive

Approach
--------
I decided to use AngularJS, building the app by writing feature tests with Protractor first to fulfill the requirements in the order above and Karma with Jasmine for unit testing. I wasn't sure if I should use Express as a server but decided against it to keep things simple. The product data has been mocked in a RESTful API and the discounts can be applied by entering voucher codes for each offer. The codes are **5off**, **10off** and **15off**.
